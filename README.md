# multi-stage-amplifier
Designing a multi stage amplifier with the specification:


• Power supply: +10V relative to the ground;

• Current drawn from power supply: less than 10 mA;

• No-load voltage gain (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧): |Avo| = 55;

• Maximum no-load output voltage swing (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧): 8V peak to peak;

• Loaded voltage gain (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧 and with 𝑅𝐿 = 1 𝑘Ω): no smaller than 90% of the no-load voltage gain;

• Maximum loaded output voltage swing (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧 and 𝑅𝐿 = 1 𝑘Ω): 4 V peak to peak;

• Input resistance (at 1 𝑘𝑘𝐻𝐻𝑧𝑧): around 3000 kΩ;

• Amplifier type: non-inverting;

• Frequency response: 20 Hz to 50 kHz (−3db response);

• Type of transistors: 2 common emitters and 1 common collector;
